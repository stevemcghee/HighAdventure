### Docker
```bash
./deploy.sh docker
```

## 🔧 Configuration

Create a `.env` file:
```bash
cp env.example .env
```

Edit with your database settings:
```env
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@localhost:5432/high_adventure
NODE_ENV=development
```

## 📊 Database Schema

The game now uses PostgreSQL with two main tables:

- **`game_sessions`**: Stores game state and session info
- **`players`**: Tracks players in each session

## 🎮 How Multiplayer Works

1. **Session Creation**: One player creates a game session
2. **Player Joining**: Other players join the session
3. **State Synchronization**: All players see the same game state
4. **Action Broadcasting**: When a player performs an action, it's sent to all players
5. **Persistent Storage**: Game state is saved to the database

## 🛠️ Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Real-time**: Socket.IO
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Deployment**: Docker, Heroku, Vercel support

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Database Connection Issues
- Make sure PostgreSQL is running
- Check your `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
- Try `npm run setup-db` to test connection

### Socket.IO Issues
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure you're using `http://localhost:3000` (not file://)
- Verify the server is running

### Game Start Issues
- Make sure to click the "🚀 Start Game" button to begin
- All controls are disabled until the game is started
- Check that the game status shows "Game is running" after starting

### Deployment Issues
- Check environment variables are set
- Ensure database is accessible from deployment platform
- Verify all dependencies are installed

## 🎉 Ready to Play!
